# Fruits 360 Recognition - CNN & Transfer Learning

### Project Overview
This project implements fruit and vegetable recognition on the Fruits 360 dataset (90,483 images, 131 classes) using deep learning approaches. The task is divided into two parts: building a custom CNN from scratch, and applying transfer learning with fine-tuning to achieve higher accuracy.

### Part 1: Custom CNN Implementation
- Build and train a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow 2.x/PyTorch
- Implement data augmentation techniques
- Achieve minimum 90% accuracy on test set
- Architecture includes at least one convolutional layer

### Part 2: Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning
- Leverage pre-trained models from tf.keras.applications
- Apply transfer learning by modifying top layers
- Implement fine-tuning of pre-trained weights
- Target accuracy: minimum 94%
- Compare performance of both approaches

### Key Features
- Complete image classification pipeline
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Custom CNN architecture design
- Transfer learning implementation
- Fine-tuning strategies
- Performance evaluation and comparison
